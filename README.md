# NodeServer Example

Be sure to follow the NodeTest example to understand the setup of a Node project first.

We're using Express as the web framework to power this server.

## Steps of Setup

```
mkdir NodeServer
npm init
# Fill in everything as expected
# Use Mocha for testing
# Use index.js for the entry point
# Edit package.json to add a 'start'
mkdir test
mkdir app
npm install mocha --save-dev
npm install express --save
```
